## ✅ Final verification (important)
1. Refresh the repository page
2. You should now see:
 - Big title
 - Bullet points
 - Code block
 - **NO `%PDF-1.4` anywhere**

If you see formatted text → **problem solved permanently**.

## Why this keeps happening (lesson learned)
- A PDF generated by ReportLab was **accidentally saved as README.md**
- Git doesn’t know or care — it just tracks bytes
- Editing on GitHub guarantees it’s **plain text Markdown**

This is **very common** in ML projects that generate PDFs. You didn’t mess up — you learned something important.

## Optional next cleanups (recommended later)
- Add `.gitignore` to remove `venv/`
- Move any PDFs into a `docs/` folder
- Add screenshots section for recruiters

But first: **do the GitHub edit above**.  
Once done, reply with: **“README fixed”** and I’ll confirm the next best improvement.
